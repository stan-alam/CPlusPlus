## Programming Abstractions in C++

```text
Over the last decade, the world of computing has grown vastly more exciting. The
networked devices that most of us carry in our pockets have become faster, less
expensive, and more powerful. Web-based services like Google and Wikipedia
have put much of the world’s information at our fingertips. Social networks have
connected us with people throughout the world. Streaming technologies and faster
hardware have made it possible to download music and video any time we want it.
These technologies, however, don’t just happen; someone has to build them.
Unfortunately, people with the necessary software-development skills are in short
supply. At the center of the high-tech economy in Silicon Valley, companies cannot
find the engineering talent they need to turn technological visions into reality.

**In particular, companies are desperate to find people who know how to develop and
maintain large systems—software developers who understand such issues as data
representation, efficiency, security, correctness, and modularity.**

Although this book won’t teach you everything you need to know about these
topics and the broader field of computer science, it will give you a good start. At
Stanford, over 1000 students a year take the course that uses this textbook. Many of
those students find summer internships or industry jobs with no more background
than working through this book provides. An even larger number of students
continue on to more advanced courses that prepare them for the seemingly
boundless opportunities that exist in this rapidly expanding field.
Beyond the opportunities they offer in the computing industry, the topics in this
book are full of intellectual excitement. The algorithms and strategies you learn in
this book—some of which were invented in the last decade while others have been
around for more than 2000 years—are incredibly clever and stand as monuments to
human creativity. They are also eminently practical and will help you become a
much more sophisticated programmer.
As you study the material in this book, please keep in mind that programming is
always a matter of learning by doing. Reading about an algorithmic technique does
not mean that you will be able to apply that algorithm in practice. Your real
learning will come from working through the exercises and debugging your early
attempts at solving those problems. Programming can be frustrating at times, but
the thrill of finding that last bug and watching your program work is so profound
that it more than makes up for any difficulties you encounter along the way.
